# Udacity FEND- Project #3:  Memory Game - ZOO Edition

A browser-based card matching game inteded for kids. Goal is to find all 15 matches as quickly as possible. Game will be rated on number of moves player takes to discover all matches.

## How it works?

* The player flips first card over to reveal its underlying image.
* Then player flips over a second card, looking for a card with the same image.
* Only two cards can be open per turn.
* If the cards match, both cards stay open and player is a step closer to win.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped back and it's time to try again.
* The game ends once all cards have been matched.
*The game tracks number of moves and time necessary to discover all pairs.
* Player is able to stop the timer and continue the game afterwards.

## To Do
* Add different levels for the game:
    -Easy -> 9 pairs
    -Medium -> 12 pairs
    -Hard -> 15 pairs
    - adjust the number of moves to correspond with difficulty
*Add more themes
    -Farm animals
    -Mountain & forrest
    -Ocean
    -Birds
    -I have graphics ready - just  need to write the code
*LeaderBoard - this could be a cool feature which could add a sense of purpose to the game.
    -leaderboard should prompt player to enter their name
    - Ranking takes in consideration number of moves and time
    -More advanced version could include user profiles with their previous games saved and ranked (veeery optional)

## Contributing
My list of todos is not so extensive - but if you'd like to play with my code - feel free to do so. I'd love to collaborate so any of the todos I'd gladly include. There are only two requirements I have to for the push request to be accepted:
    -code is written in Vanilla JS
    -code is working!

Thank you in advance if you decide to tackle with this one!

## Acknowledgments
* This project was inspired by my daughter. And she's also a reason why it took forever to finish! Attempting to do programming while keeping an eye on a toddler is not - well, ideal - to put it mildly. But she's very happy that mommy made her a game; with animals - as per request!

* I want  to thank to Udacity, my mentor and my classmates for being an amazing support in times when I felt like banging my head to a wall because code wouldn't work! Y'all are the best!
